# Project Proposal: Chess Opening Performance Visualizer

## 1. High-Level Goal

To develop an interactive web application that visualizes and compares statistical performance (win/draw/loss rates) of different chess openings, categorized by player Elo ratings.

## 2. Goals and Motivation

**Motivation:** Driven by a passion for chess and recognizing the need for an intuitive visual tool for opening analysis, our team aims to create a platform beneficial to the chess community. Currently, analyzing and comparing opening effectiveness often relies on large statistical tables or requires deep knowledge of chess databases. This project seeks to simplify that process, enabling players of all levels, including ourselves, to make more informed opening choices, better understand the strengths and weaknesses of various lines, and effectively find counters. Furthermore, this project provides an opportunity for the team to apply and enhance skills in data crawling, large data processing, web development, and data visualization.

**Goals & Problem Solving:** The primary goal is to transform complex statistical data about chess openings into intuitive, dynamic, and easily understandable visual charts (pie charts, histogram chart). This project addresses the lack of online tools that allow users to **easily and interactively** compare the performance of two or more specific openings side-by-side, especially considering performance variations across different skill levels (Elo brackets). Instead of manually compiling information from disparate sources or deciphering dense tables, users will have a centralized interface to explore this data visually. We aim to bridge the gap between raw chess game data and actionable insights for players by presenting win rates, usage statistics, and performance trends based on Elo in a clear graphical format.

**Why this project is interesting/important:** Opening analysis is crucial for chess improvement. Providing a visual tool democratizes access to analytical insights, extending beyond professional players or data analysts. It helps players grasp opening dynamics based on statistical evidence rather than just intuition or general advice. The project fills a niche for a *visual and flexible* opening comparison tool filtered by Elo, offering a novel way to interact with chess statistics. Successful completion would benefit players by guiding opening selection, aid coaches/analysts with a quick reference tool, and significantly develop our team's practical skills in data science and web technologies, potentially serving as a foundation for more advanced chess analytics projects.

## 3. Project Focus and Data Handling

**Focus:** The project focuses on building a client-side (frontend-focused) web application to visualize pre-processed chess opening statistics. The backend's role will primarily be to serve this aggregated data to the frontend.

**Data Source and Collection:** The primary intended data source is the game database from `chesstempo.com/game-database/`. Due to the large volume of data and the need for specific game details (opening played, player Elos, results), **web crawling/scraping** is the planned data collection method.
* **Important Note:** We must carefully review ChessTempo's Terms of Service to ensure crawling is permitted. If restricted, we will explore alternative data sources (e.g., Lichess Open Database, FICS games database) or available smaller datasets.

**Data Processing, Storage, and Management:**
* **Crawling:** We plan to use Python with libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, or `Scrapy` to automate the download and extraction of necessary information from game pages. Error handling and rate limiting will be implemented to avoid overloading the source server.
* **Processing:** Raw crawled data (individual game info) will be processed and aggregated. This involves identifying the specific opening from initial moves, categorizing players into appropriate Elo brackets, and calculating win/draw/loss percentages for each compared opening pair, overall and per Elo bracket.
* **Storage:** Raw data might be temporarily stored in files (CSV, JSON Lines). The crucial **processed/aggregated data** for visualization (e.g., Opening A vs Opening B, Elo 1200-1400: White Win X%, Draw Y%, Black Win Z%) will likely be stored in a format efficient for frontend consumption, such as static JSON files or potentially a simple database (like SQLite) bundled with the application. Pre-calculating these statistics will optimize the web application's loading speed.
* **Management:** Data will be clearly structured. The processing pipeline will be documented. The final aggregated data format will be optimized for querying and display on the frontend.
